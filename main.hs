    Okay, things look pretty good so far!

    Next up:

        2. Improve our resolution algorithm implementation. Right now we just
        try every possible combination, which is easy to write, but terribly
        inefficient. We should do a proper search algorithm.

        Note: After finishing 3, I think it's cool to find the shortest
        possible proof. We could look at more efficient SAT algorithms, but
        they won't find the shortest one. We'll need to stress test the current
        algorithm and see when it becomes unbearably slow.

        4. Implement a REPL.

    Done:

        1. Improved parser and error handling.

        3. Implemented a simple BFS proof search. This stores the steps and
        also finds the *shortest* proof, if one exists. There's also a proof
        printer now.
