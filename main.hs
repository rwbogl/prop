    Okay, things look pretty good so far!

    Next up:

        Improve the data structure design. I have plans to implement a few
        different proof algorithms, and the current design is awful. There are
        `DisList`s and `CNF`s floating around everywhere.

        I think that some of this could be cleared up by using `newtype` rather
        than `type` to define the `DisList` and `CNF` types, but I might have
        to experiment a bit and find out.
