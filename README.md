# proph

A simple resolution-based theorem prover for propositional logic in Haskell.

This small program was started to learn more about resolution-based theorem
proving and Haskell. I started it after [Write Yourself a Scheme in 48
Hours](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Write_Yourself_a_Scheme_in_48_Hours)
became boring. (And because of this starting point, much of the parsing
components are weak.)
